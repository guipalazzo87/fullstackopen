This is the frontend application for the phonebook exercise parts 2 through 3 from Full Stack Open.

The "production build" for this is hosted on https://desolate-ravine-53175.herokuapp.com/.

I've got successfully streamlined the build pipeline through the backend node server (repository https://github.com/guipalazzo87/phonebook-backend) with the "npm run deploy:full", which will build, commit and push to heroku main.
